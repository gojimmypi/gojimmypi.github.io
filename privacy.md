Privacy information.

## No Assumed Privacy

Generally on the internet, there's no privacy these days. Sad, I know.

That said, I try to not have any sort of invasive tracking. I currently have no ads and no sponsored contents.

I do not personally capture or sell any information.

Views are my own, not representative of any other company or organization, and may sometimes be inaccurate.

## Open Source

This entire site is open source, hosted as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) at [github.com/gojimmypi/gojimmypi.github.io](https://github.com/gojimmypi/gojimmypi.github.io)
with a preview rendered in the `gridster-jekyll-theme` subdirectory from [github.com/gojimmypi/gridster-jekyll-theme/](https://github.com/gojimmypi/gridster-jekyll-theme/)

I suspect both Microsoft and GitHub have their own internal tracking.

## Analytics

To improve the web experience for everyone, I use some additional analytics tools for testing and evaluating the content.

I use the Google Analytics and [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about). See the `google_analytics: true` in the [_config.yml](./_config.yml) file.

Recently I started also using [ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/). See the `ahrefs_analytics: true` in the [_config.yml](./_config.yml) file.
