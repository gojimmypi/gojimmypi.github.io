My January efforts have focused on writing C# on an embedded device. Yes, you read that correctly: C-Sharp. On and Embedded device. WOW! In my case, the ESP32 onboard the Radiona ULX3S. This is all thanks to the clever folks working on the <a href="http://docs.nanoframework.net/">nanoFramework</a>
.<br />
<br />
I have an interim walk-though on my SSD1331 GitHub branch here:

<br />I'm currently working on figuring out how to compile the interpreter. See the

This is a work in progress, so come back for updates.
