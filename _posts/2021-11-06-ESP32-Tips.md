Various tips and reminders when developing for the ESP32.

Problem:
Forgot how to program with idf.

Solution:
{% include code_header.html %}
```bash
cd ~/esp/esp-idf
 . $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
idf.py -p /dev/ttyS9 -b 230400 flash monitor
```

Problem:
forgot how to change flash size
```
--flash_size 2MB
```

Problem: Forgot how to use IDY to monitor serial port. (`Ctrl-[` to exit)
```
idf.py -p /dev/ttyS9 -b 230400  monitor
```

Problem: 
`A fatal error occurred: Failed to connect to ESP32: Timed out waiting for packet header.`

Solution 1:
Press the `BOOT` button

Solution 2:
Program with a slower speed `--baud 115200`



Problem  `nvs_flash_init()` hanging for seemingly no reason:
{% include code_header.html %}
```
ESP_ERROR_CHECK(nvs_flash_init());
```

Solution: 
Temporarily put a different project on the board, such as this wolfSSL benchmark:

{% include code_header.html %}
```bash
cd ~/esp/esp-idf
 . $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh

WORKSPACE=/mnt/c/workspace
THIS_PROJECT=my_wolfssl3

cp -r $IDF_PATH/examples/protocols/wolfssl_benchmark $THIS_PROJECT
cd $THIS_PROJECT
make

```
