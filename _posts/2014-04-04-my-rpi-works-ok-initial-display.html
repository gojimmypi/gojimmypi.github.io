My Rpi works! Ok, the initial display on my old tv was rather poor, but these settings via:<br />
<br />
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
<br />
<br />
specifically adding:
<br />
<br />
hdmi_group=1
<br />
hdmi_mode=4
<br />
<br />
...ensures I am displaying hdmi in 720p (my old tv only displays 1024i = super blurry!)
<br />
<br />For more information on forcing video modes, see 
<a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_config.txt#Video">
the elinux RPi Config (video section)</a><br />
<br />I no longer need a keyboard and mouse attached to my RPi! I found 
<a href="http://www.raspberrypiblog.com/2012/10/how-to-setup-remote-desktop-from.html">this blog on how to setup RDP</a>
&nbsp;and now I can access my RPi from the comfort of my Windows 7 machine. &lt;sigh of contentment&gt;<br />
<br />
Basically, to setup RDP, rum this command:
<br />
<br />
sudo apt-get install xrdp
<br />
<br />
(xwindows rdp, how cool is that!?)
<br />
<br />For reference, I used 
<a href="https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/eula_windows/">this SD formatter</a> to initialize my new SD card to install <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Raspian via the NOOBS installer (a simple copy to CD)</a>. Much more information on setup options can be found <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup">
on the elinux "Easy CD Card Setup"</a><br />
<br />
The RPi is ridiculously cool.&nbsp; I've been out of the hardware world for way too long.
