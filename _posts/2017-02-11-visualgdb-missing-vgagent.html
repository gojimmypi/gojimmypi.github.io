This morning my <a href="https://visualgdb.com/">VisualGDB</a>&nbsp;starting giving me problems with weird error messages about a missing file called <b>vgagent.exe</b>

<br />

Rather than fuss with it, I decided might as well re-install - as I noticed there was an incrementally newer version available. So I downloaded VisualGDB-5.2r8-trial.msi (the previous one I downloaded was&nbsp;VisualGDB-5.2r7-trial.msi from January) from the&nbsp;<a href="https://visualgdb.com/download/">Sysprogs VisualGDB download page</a>.

<br />

All installed successfully and I was able to resume my attempts at getting my Segger JTAG to debug the ESP8266 (which I <a href="http://gojimmypi.blogspot.com/2017/02/esp8266-jtag-debugging-in-visual-studio.html">did</a>!)

<br />

After taking a break for a few hours, when I returned Norton Anti-virus had popped an alert that it had detected Heur.AdvML.B&nbsp;

<br />

</a>

<br />

<br />
and this screen snip of the prior removal of the same-name file just yesterday:

</a>
<br />
<br />

googling Heur.AdvML.B and&nbsp;there appears to be many suspect bait-and-infect links (so be careful when clicking).

<br />

There's also a thread on the Norton forum that questions whether these are false positives:

<br />

<a href="https://community.norton.com/en/forums/heuradvmlb-detected-false-positive-or-not">https://community.norton.com/en/forums/heuradvmlb-detected-false-positive-or-not</a>

<br />

I've posted <a href="https://sysprogs.com/w/forums/topic/missing-vgagent-exe-problem-norton-av-thinks-it-is-infected-with-heur-advml-b/">this question on the syslogs forum</a>&nbsp;(hopefully it is indeed simply a false positive).
