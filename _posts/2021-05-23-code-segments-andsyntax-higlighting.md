I'm using the defauly Jekyll sytax highlighter that works well, until it doesn't. Reminder that language tags
are CASE SENSTIVE!

````md
```html
<div>good sample</div>
```
and NOT:

```HTML
<div>bad sample</div>
```
````

All sorts of things seem to go wrong when the language spec, in the above example `HTML` is not lower case.


Thanks Dan Vega for the tip on [How to escape a backtic within a code block in markdown](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2019/05/31/escape-backtick-markdown/):

> _"The first solution to our problem is to use more backticks. You will need to place 4 of them around your code block that contains 3."_

Next, when using mardown `md` files, note that the liquid `include code_header.html` needs to be manually included. It is missing above, and present below:

{% include code_header.html %}
````md
{% raw %}{% include code_header.html %}{% endraw %}
```html
<div>good sample</div>
```
````
