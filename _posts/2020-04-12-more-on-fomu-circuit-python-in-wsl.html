<br />After the 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-04-11-circuit-python-on-fomu-in-wsl-plus %}">previous pains</a> of getting Circuit Python to just <i>build</i> for the FOMU, it is time to move on to more interesting things.... actually <i>putting it on</i>
 the FOMU!<br />
<br />Back to 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-03-08-risc-v-circuit-python-on-ulx3s-starting %}">my first notes</a>&nbsp;on this topic,&nbsp;the dfu-util is needed. There are a variety of sources of this app. Unfortunately the only one I was able to get working was from the ad-spam-laden sourceforge (it's really a shame what that site has become). Fortunately there's a <a href="https://github.com/ulx3s/dfu-util">ULX3S dfu-util repo</a> with a <a href="https://github.com/ulx3s/dfu-util/blob/master/bin-win64/dfu-util.exe">precompiled binary</a>. No ads.&nbsp; (If you, too are tired of so may ads, check out my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-02-23-raspberry-pi-pi-hole-setup-notes %}">pi-hole blog</a>
).<br />
<br />At this early stage of the game, there's really quite limited documentation available. One observation from the 
<a href="https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/blob/master/ports/litex/Makefile">Makefile</a> is that during the (by default relatively quiet) build of Circuit Python... the <i>only</i>
 thing happening there is just that: the RISC-V (more specifically&nbsp;VexRiscv) compile of "C" code into a binary DFU file. This means that the FOMU needs to have been pre-configured: make the FPGA a soft CPU.<br />
<br />Fortunately, I had already loaded 
<a href="https://github.com/im-tomu/foboot">foboot</a>&nbsp;onto my FOMU. Specifically, I took the shortcut of using a pre-built version of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/im-tomu/foboot/blob/master/releases/v2.0.3/hacker-updater-v2.0.3.dfu">hacker-updater-v2.0.3.dfu</a> as noted&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb/issues/293#issuecomment-599227050">here</a>
. To do something using with another FPGA, say... the ULX3S... clearly I'm going to have to get control of building that bitstream.<br />
<br />
But for now, let's run with that. The FOMU is configured as a soft CPU, which we learned from the Circuit Python text file is a VexRisc. The "only" thing needed is some code for it to run: Circuit Python.
<br />
<br />
There's an apt-get install version of dfu-util for Ubuntu, but it does not work in WSL. It does not "see" the FOMU

unable to initialize libusb: LIBUSB_ERROR_OTHER
gojimmypi:~</code></pre>
Of course, I'm doing this in WSL (not WSL2).. and there are <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/2185">known problems with native USB drivers not working in WSL</a>. Given the libusb error, I'm pretty sure neither of those linux versions of dfu-util will ever work. However, one of the amazing things about WSL: Native Windows and DOS apps can be launched from the command prompt! The DOS version <i>does</i>
 work!<br />

Note that I have DFU Bootloader v2.0.3 installed on the FOMU as described in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-03-08-risc-v-circuit-python-on-ulx3s-starting %}">my prior blog</a>. In particular, see&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb/issues/293">tinyusb issues #293</a>&nbsp;for some oddities that I encountered when using older versions of the bootloader.

Note that this is a "soft" program of the FPGA. The <code class="highlight">firmware.dfu</code>
 can't be sent to the FOMU again until power cycle. In fact, after a power cycle, it *needs* to be sent again. Normally I might say something about preventing corruption to be careful to to the USB eject. But after removing the device, it is no longer a Circuit Python.<br />
<br />
For reference, to put foboot in place:

The thing is: we don't have a bootloader for the ULX3S. It does not show up as a device for dfu-util. Recall we use the ujprog to upload FPGA bitstreams to the FPGA, and the litex_term to upload the firwmware.bin file.<br />
<br />As noted in a prior blog, I have a 
<a href="https://github.com/gojimmypi/ulx3s-toolchain/blob/master/soft_cpu.sh">soft CPU script</a>
 that shows how this is done on the ULX3S:<br />

<br />Unfortunately, I've spent a bunch of time chasing 
<a href="https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/issues/465">toolchain</a> and <a href="https://github.com/litex-hub/litex-boards/issues/66">memory</a>
 problems. After updating everything to solve a problem where Migen was not creating a top.v file (which as it turns out, was even not necessary to solve the problem I was seeing), LiteX is now complaining that memtest is failing.<br />
<br />My specific memory chip on my ULX3S is a&nbsp;

.&nbsp;I did at least learn how to do a memory check:<br />

&nbsp;A good memory test looks like this on an HDMI monitor:<br />
<br />

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="../images/s1600/good_memory_test.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">
<img alt="illustration image" border="0" data-original-height="600" data-original-width="1200" height="160" src="../images/s320/good_memory_test.jpg" width="320"></a>
</div>
<br />
The top line is not used. The middle line is the number of memory tests completed. The red bottom line is the number of errors.
<br />
<br />
A bad memory test, say when a 64MB test is loaded for a 32MB chip, looks like this:\\
<br />
<br />

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="../images/s1600/bad_memory_test.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">

</div>
<br />The 64MB test blinks onboard LEDs like 
<a href="https://twitter.com/gojimmypi/status/1249451852103483392?s=20">this</a>
. The 32MB test does not.<br />
<br />In the meantime, there are some really 
<a href="https://twitter.com/GregDavill/status/1249335600898912256?s=20">quite talented folks that do this stuff rather easily</a>
. Perhaps I'll have more luck next time.<br />
