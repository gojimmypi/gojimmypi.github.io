I'm applying to speak at [Arduino Days 2025](https://days.arduino.cc/)!

"Getting Started with wolfSSL on Arduino"

Arduino is a key ecosystem not only the makers and hobbyists, but professionals that use the Arduino platform for rapid prototyping of concepts before making custom hardware.

The [wolfSSL embedded SSL library](https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfssl/)
(formerly CyaSSL) is a lightweight SSL/TLS library written in ANSI C and
targeted for embedded, RTOS, and resource-constrained environments - primarily
because of its small size, speed, and feature set.  It is commonly used in
standard operating environments as well because of its royalty-free pricing
and excellent cross platform support. wolfSSL supports industry standards up
to the current [TLS 1.3](https://www.wolfssl.com/tls13) and DTLS 1.3, is up to
20 times smaller than OpenSSL, and offers progressive ciphers such as ChaCha20,
Curve25519, Blake2b and Post-Quantum TLS 1.3 groups. User benchmarking and
feedback reports dramatically better performance when using wolfSSL over
OpenSSL.

wolfSSL is powered by the wolfCrypt cryptography library. Two versions of
wolfCrypt have been FIPS 140-2 validated (Certificate #2425 and
certificate #3389). FIPS 140-3 validation is in progress. For additional
information, visit the [wolfCrypt FIPS FAQ](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/fips/)
or contact fips@wolfssl.com.
