<p>These are my (admittedly sometimes long and rambling) thoughts and more of a "review" of my recent purchase. I'm planning a second blog with just the details on setting up. Stay tuned.</p><p>My first "full disk" image was pulled from the GOES-17 Satellite on <a href="https://twitter.com/gojimmypi/status/1325599563906867200?s=20">November 8</a>!</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UdT2jK0rMog/X63bnuB2YWI/AAAAAAAAC_0/iSkVGhnadiE-Q8XxigYLwfaM0Ro-7LlPwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1216/helloworld%2B-%2Bblog.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="849" data-original-width="1216" height="279" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UdT2jK0rMog/X63bnuB2YWI/AAAAAAAAC_0/iSkVGhnadiE-Q8XxigYLwfaM0Ro-7LlPwCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h279/helloworld%2B-%2Bblog.png" width="400" /></a></div><p>I've been wanting to learn about satellite reception and SDR signal processing for quite some time. I have pretty much zero experience here. I've never even owned a TV satellite dish. This is certainly not my first SDR product from Nooelec. I first received their&nbsp;<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01HA642SW/">NESDR Smart RTL-SDR</a>&nbsp;as a birthday present several years ago, and really enjoyed setting up&nbsp;<a href="https://gojimmypi.blogspot.com/2017/07/openwrt-on-ea3500-with-rtl-sdr-stream.html">OpenWRT on EA3500 with RTL-SDR Stream</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I was inspired to buy the <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HGQXC7C/">Nooelec kit on Amazon</a>&nbsp;after reading about it on the <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/new-goes-weather-satellite-bundle-from-nooelec/">RTL SDR blog</a>, in particular the quite excellent <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-com-goes-16-17-and-gk-2a-weather-satellite-reception-comprehensive-tutorial/">online tutorial on GOES 16/17 Weather Satellite Reception</a>. This was somewhat of a gamble, as I bought mine before any of the reviews on Amazon. (there are now <i>several </i>5 star reviews!)</p><p>I first tried&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOES-17">137.2W GOES-S (GOES-17)</a>.</p><p>See also the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amateursatellites/comments/jqcaxl/psa_what_you_need_to_know_about_goes13/">reddit PSA PSA: What you need to know about GOES-13</a>:</p><blockquote style="border: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px;"><p style="text-align: left;"><i>The hardware and software requirements for successful GOES-13 decoding are completely different from GOES-16/17 and all other L-Band geostationary weather satellites, do not expect the same setup that works for LRIT/HRIT to work with GOES-13</i></p> </blockquote><p>Update: The&nbsp;<a href="http://usradioguy.com/goes-satellite-imagery-reception/">USRADIOGUY GOES Satellite Imagery Reception</a>&nbsp;is a great place for info, that would have been quite helpful had I known about it when I started.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that if you go looking for those PDF files at the end in the <a href="https://github.com/creinemann/goestools#resources">resources section</a>, they are no longer available. I contacted&nbsp;NOAA support and they responded within 24 hours and even included the files! I submitted an <a href="https://github.com/pietern/goestools/pull/102">upstream PR</a>, but it looks like there has not been much activity recently. I have a copy in my WIP <a href="https://github.com/gojimmypi/goes-setup/tree/main/doc">GOES-Setup docs</a>.</p><p>When the kit arrived, I thought the dish was all one piece, as it arrived in one of the biggest Amazon boxes I've ever received. Is the box half full or half empty? I think it is twice as big as it needs to be, just the right size for two of them:</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Zs0Y_MT-jxc/X6w2NjUgQTI/AAAAAAAAC_Q/9mocyBNE6fYBtC6o0kxIagofIxltpqUQgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1289/IMG-20201111-WA0002.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="739" data-original-width="1289" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Zs0Y_MT-jxc/X6w2NjUgQTI/AAAAAAAAC_Q/9mocyBNE6fYBtC6o0kxIagofIxltpqUQgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/IMG-20201111-WA0002.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><p>The out-of-box experience was a bit frustrating. There was pretty much no documentation included on assembly or operation. The only thing included was a thank-you card with a link to <a href="http://start.nesdr.com">start.nesdr.com</a>&nbsp;which as of the time if this writing, just redirected to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nooelec.com/store/qs">nooelec.com/store/qs</a>&nbsp;with nothing more than basic information on how install the drivers.&nbsp;</p><p>Update: there's now a helpful&nbsp;<a href="https://support.nooelec.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058812593-Nooelec-GOES-Weather-Satellite-RTL-SDR-Bundle">Set-Up Instructions</a>&nbsp;page on the Nooelec site, and they've added a setup picture on the Amazon product page:</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-enbvoK_VH-E/X6xKyJTkYGI/AAAAAAAAC_c/7bt4A-pr7dwpkTBZ1IcSJsfRAmNuNCsowCLcBGAsYHQ/s1500/connection%2Binfo.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1500" data-original-width="1370" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-enbvoK_VH-E/X6xKyJTkYGI/AAAAAAAAC_c/7bt4A-pr7dwpkTBZ1IcSJsfRAmNuNCsowCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/connection%2Binfo.jpg" /></a></div><br /><p>The "driver download" is actually just an old (Version 2.3 from 2017) of Zadig, not actually the drivers. The Nooelec web site was also annoying, as well: Google Chrome would do this annoying oscillation when hovering over the little question mark icons to view the pictures. It was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb1M4ttN4MU">exceptionally frustrating</a> to <i>just view the web picture</i>. Within 24 hours of my message to support, the Nooelec folks fixed that!</p><p>In any case, there's not much to do in Windows anyhow, as the <a href="https://usa-satcom.com/xrit-decoder-for-goes-satellite/">XRIT Decoder for GOES Satellite</a> is another $125, as <a href="https://twitter.com/Nooelec/status/1321819968791580672?s=20">noted on Twitter</a>; note in particular the link to&nbsp;<a href="https://pietern.github.io/goestools/guides/minimal_receiver.html">A minimal LRIT/HRIT receiver</a>. But I wanted to at least see if everything was working in Windows.</p> <p>Nooelec has <a href="https://www.nooelec.com/store/catalogsearch/result/?q=sawbird">several SAWbird Low Noise Amplifiers ("LNA")</a>&nbsp;for <a href="https://www.nooelec.com/store/sawbird-plus-noaa-308.html">NOAA</a>, the <a href="https://www.nooelec.com/store/sawbird-ir.html">iridium and Inmarsat</a>&nbsp;and other satellites, but the one shipped in this kit was the <a href="https://www.nooelec.com/store/sawbird-goes-305.html">GOES</a> flavor with a 1688 MHz Center Frequency: specifically the "premium" version with an aluminum enclosure. Note there's another bare board version.</p><p>The kit ships with a USB to power adapter. I had no idea if I am supposed to use it or not, as their web site claims:</p><blockquote style="border: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px;"><p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;"<i>Each module allows for 3 different power options, <b>but you should only power with one option at any given time</b></i>! <i>The recommended power input through the SMA output port (for bias-tee capable SDRs like the NESDR SMArTee XTR) is 3V-5V DC</i>".&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>As the&nbsp;NESDR SMArTee XTR was also part of the kit, I assumed the power adapter is superfluous. However the web site also states "<i>Our recommendation is the NESDR SMArTee XTR <b>v2</b>, which contains a bias-tee capable of powering the SAWbird GOES module with bias power</i>". Not a single one of&nbsp; the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nooelec.com/store/catalogsearch/result/index/?p=1&amp;q=nesdr+xtr">nesdr xtr</a>&nbsp;items made any mention of a "V2". There's one that looks similar, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nooelec.com/store/nesdr-smart-xtr-sdr.html">Nooelec NESDR SMArt XTR SDR - Premium RTL-SDR w/ Extended Tuning Range, Aluminum Enclosure, 0.5PPM TCXO, SMA Input</a>&nbsp;and another that looks exactly the same, but is labeled as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nooelec.com/store/nesdr-smartee-xtr-sdr.html">Nooelec NESDR SMArTee XTR SDR - Premium RTL-SDR w/ Extended Tuning Range, Aluminum Enclosure, Bias Tee, 0.5PPM TCXO, SMA Input</a>. (note that it mentions the "bias tee") I'm hoping the Amazon description of "<i>The NESDR SMArTee XTR SDR unit will automatically feed the LNA through a built-in always-on Bias-T</i>" is accurate and this will actually power the SAWbird.</p><p>Update: yes, it does! The power adapter is not needed; it's a bonus!</p><blockquote style="border: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px;"><p style="text-align: left;">"<i>There is no need to use the external power option.&nbsp; We opted to include the cable as it allows for easier use for customers who might want to use a different SDR for decoding than what came in the bundle</i>" -- Nooelec Support</p></blockquote> <p>The SAWbird was initially equally frustrating; an SMA connector on each end with absolutely no indication of which end is input and which is output.&nbsp;</p><p>Update: Apparently somehow my SAWbird snuck through QA missing the silkscreen (perhaps that makes it a Collector's Edition?)</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NHPTvdaai2E/X6wti9vrbDI/AAAAAAAAC-4/ileFrqZqKtQOtf7DET4TRjggEe0FHD3TQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1189/my%2BNooelec.PNG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="659" data-original-width="1189" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NHPTvdaai2E/X6wti9vrbDI/AAAAAAAAC-4/ileFrqZqKtQOtf7DET4TRjggEe0FHD3TQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/my%2BNooelec.PNG" width="320" /></a></div><p>There's a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nooelec.com/store/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1200x/040ec09b1e35df139433887a97daa66f/s/a/sawbird_2_4_2.png">poor quality picture on the Nooelec site</a>&nbsp;that shows the bare board version has the input on the USB-side of the device:</p><p><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WywybsNrj0s/X6g2rcM4cQI/AAAAAAAAC-A/duq5LlaL6HUZfLSCEpggNC93tSoYjVrkACLcBGAsYHQ/s746/sawbird_input.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="706" data-original-width="746" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WywybsNrj0s/X6g2rcM4cQI/AAAAAAAAC-A/duq5LlaL6HUZfLSCEpggNC93tSoYjVrkACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/sawbird_input.png" width="320" /></a></div>As those labels are barely visible, it is at least reassuring to see the output label on the other end:<div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-C_EZdvqDK5k/X6g27LxklTI/AAAAAAAAC-I/dYPC16JHXO8r1S-7zJOJVto8hXH5-dKjwCLcBGAsYHQ/s661/sawbird_output.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="553" data-original-width="661" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-C_EZdvqDK5k/X6g27LxklTI/AAAAAAAAC-I/dYPC16JHXO8r1S-7zJOJVto8hXH5-dKjwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/sawbird_output.png" width="320" /></a></div><div><br /></div>Although I suppose it makes sense to have power input on the antenna input site of the SAWbird, it ends up being the <i>opposite </i>end of the USB input on the SMArtee device.

Then I loaded up <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonelli.juicessh&amp;hl=en_US">juice ssh</a> on a mobile device (or you could take a laptop), and manually adjusted the dish to get the vit(avg) values as low as possible.</div><div><br /></div><div>   And don't be discouraged if all packets are initially dropped, it may take a bit of time for the signal to lock:    <pre><code>pi@raspberrypi:~ $ goesrecv -c goes.conf -v -i 1<br />Detached kernel driver<br />Found Elonics E4000 tuner<br />Disabled direct sampling mode<br />[E4K] PLL not locked for 0 Hz!<br />Exact sample rate is: 2000000.052982 Hz<br />Allocating 15 zero-copy buffers<br />2020-11-09T15:49:02Z [monitor] gain:  2.82, freq:    34.9, omega: 2.157, vit(avg): 1149, rs(sum):    0, packets:  0, drops: 40<br />2020-11-09T15:49:03Z [monitor] gain:  3.07, freq:    26.5, omega: 2.157, vit(avg): 1151, rs(sum):    0, packets:  0, drops: 54<br />2020-11-09T15:49:04Z [monitor] gain:  3.07, freq:    12.2, omega: 2.157, vit(avg): 1150, rs(sum):    0, packets:  0, drops: 56<br />2020-11-09T15:49:05Z [monitor] gain:  3.07, freq:    -4.6, omega: 2.157, vit(avg): 1172, rs(sum):    0, packets:  0, drops: 54<br />2020-11-09T15:49:06Z [monitor] gain:  3.08, freq:    -7.8, omega: 2.157, vit(avg): 1148, rs(sum):    0, packets:  0, drops: 57<br />2020-11-09T15:49:07Z [monitor] gain:  3.08, freq:    -1.2, omega: 2.157, vit(avg): 1166, rs(sum):    0, packets:  0, drops: 57<br />2020-11-09T15:49:08Z [monitor] gain:  3.08, freq:    13.2, omega: 2.158, vit(avg): 1164, rs(sum):    0, packets:  0, drops: 51<br />2020-11-09T15:49:09Z [monitor] gain:  3.08, freq:    -9.9, omega: 2.157, vit(avg): 1143, rs(sum):    0, packets:  0, drops: 52<br />2020-11-09T15:49:10Z [monitor] gain:  3.08, freq:    32.7, omega: 2.158, vit(avg): 1217, rs(sum):    0, packets:  0, drops: 52<br />2020-11-09T15:49:11Z [monitor] gain:  3.09, freq:  -870.8, omega: 2.157, vit(avg):  821, rs(sum):   16, packets: 19, drops: 35<br />2020-11-09T15:49:12Z [monitor] gain:  3.09, freq: -2376.1, omega: 2.157, vit(avg):  199, rs(sum):   76, packets: 55, drops:  0<br />2020-11-09T15:49:13Z [monitor] gain:  3.09, freq: -2352.7, omega: 2.158, vit(avg):  196, rs(sum):   65, packets: 56, drops:  0<br />2020-11-09T15:49:14Z [monitor] gain:  3.09, freq: -2351.0, omega: 2.157, vit(avg):  196, rs(sum):   76, packets: 57, drops:  0<br />2020-11-09T15:49:15Z [monitor] gain:  3.09, freq: -2391.0, omega: 2.158, vit(avg):  195, rs(sum):   64, packets: 58, drops:  0<br />2020-11-09T15:49:16Z [monitor] gain:  3.09, freq: -2377.3, omega: 2.158, vit(avg):  199, rs(sum):   83, packets: 55, drops:  0<br />2020-11-09T15:49:17Z [monitor] gain:  3.10, freq: -2337.0, omega: 2.158, vit(avg):  197, rs(sum):   89, packets: 57, drops:  0<br />2020-11-09T15:49:18Z [monitor] gain:  3.09, freq: -2385.5, omega: 2.157, vit(avg):  195, rs(sum):   52, packets: 58, drops:  0<br />2020-11-09T15:49:19Z [monitor] gain:  3.09, freq: -2393.7, omega: 2.158, vit(avg):  196, rs(sum):   72, packets: 56, drops:  0<br />2020-11-09T15:49:20Z [monitor] gain:  3.10, freq: -2389.4, omega: 2.158, vit(avg):  196, rs(sum):  103, packets: 56, drops:  0<br />  </code></pre>  <br />         <pre><code># Example configuration file for goesproc<br />#<br /># This tool is designed to run on streaming data (live or recorded)<br /># and product whatever is listed in this file.
