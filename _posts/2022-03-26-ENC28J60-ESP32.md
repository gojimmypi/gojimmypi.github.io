Some tips on hooking up wired-ethernet ENC28J60 to the ESP32.

I found this helpful review for the [Hiletgo Enc28j60 reseau LAN Ethernet Module on Amazon](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B00WX1NRO0/):

>_MOSI on the board is ST (one would expect SI), the interrupt pin is LNT (again, INT is to be expected), there's a Q3 pin whose functionality is lost on me because the pinout on HiLetgo's schematic doesn't specify it, there's a second ground pin, and while the power pin specifies 5V, this board should not operate with a 5V input unless there's some unknown level shifter within the board._
_The main problem I had on startup was the unstable oscillator. I realized later that the power and ground pins on the PCB were shorted. As soon as I used the other ground on the board, the issue was solved and the chip operated as is specified on the datasheet. It's a really weird solution to a really simple problem that wouldn't happen had there been sufficient quality control._

This [Hiletgo ENC28J60 schematic from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-ENC28J60-Ethernet-Network-Arduino/dp/B00WX1NRO0):

There are at least two different ENC28J60 boards, each with completely different pins and labeling. One is obvous, the other no so much.
Fortunately [gildas] posted [some useful information on the arduino site](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/wrong-ethernet-module-12-pins-on-enc28j60/261712/6)
, see also [njh/EtherCard](https://github.com/njh/EtherCard) regarding the second pinout:

|        | 3V3      |   3.3v   |   Q3  | GND   |   GND     |    GND |         |

Use _either_ 5V/GND *OR* Q3/GND (3.3v) - but not both!

## ENC28J60 Pinout Wiring

From Espressif [Pin Assignment](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/ethernet/enc28j60#pin-assignment) example:

```
SPI_CLK   -> GPIO19
SPI_MOSI  -> GPIO23
SPI_MISO  -> GPIO25
SPI_CS    -> GPIO22
Interrupt -> GPIO4
