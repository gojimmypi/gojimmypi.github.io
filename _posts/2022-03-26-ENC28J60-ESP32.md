Some tips on hooking up wired-ethernet ENC28J60 to the ESP32.

I found this helpful review for the [Hiletgo Enc28j60 reseau LAN Ethernet Module on Amazon](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B00WX1NRO0/):

>_MOSI on the board is ST (one would expect SI), the interrupt pin is LNT (again, INT is to be expected), there's a Q3 pin whose functionality is lost on me because the pinout on HiLetgo's schematic doesn't specify it, there's a second ground pin, and while the power pin specifies 5V, this board should not operate with a 5V input unless there's some unknown level shifter within the board._ 
_The main problem I had on startup was the unstable oscillator. I realized later that the power and ground pins on the PCB were shorted. As soon as I used the other ground on the board, the issue was solved and the chip operated as is specified on the datasheet. It's a really weird solution to a really simple problem that wouldn't happen had there been sufficient quality control._

# ENC28J60 Pinout Wiring

From Espressif [Pin Assignment](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/ethernet/enc28j60#pin-assignment) example:

```
SPI_CLK   -> GPIO19	
SPI_MOSI  -> GPIO23	
SPI_MISO  -> GPIO25	
SPI_CS    -> GPIO22	
Interrupt -> GPIO4	
```
