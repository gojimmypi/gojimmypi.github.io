<a href="https://twitter.com/gojimmypi/status/1051172922964893696">Some time ago I bought a personal CNC machine</a>, as I had always wanted to learn more about gcode and in general what could be done with a home CNC machine. I also used the excuse that I would be able to make prototype PCB quickly. Nearly 2 years later, I have not yet etched a single PCB with it. So many fun projects, so little time!&nbsp;
</div>
 <br /> 

<div>
The CNC arrived in kit form and required (relatively straightforward) assembly, which was really enjoyable. I ordered this <a href="https://twowincnctool.aliexpress.com/store/group/3018/1988027_512425692.html">TwoWin Pro 3018 from Aliexpress</a>. It's definitely a low-end CNC machine, but for the price I am quite happy with it. While it is certainly not going to be machining a new engine block - it is completely capable of light-duty PCB etching and similar work.
</div>
 <br /> 

<div>
As noted in my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-08-22-notes-on-upgrading-t962a-reflow-oven %}">prior blog</a>, I purchased (and "upgraded") a T962A Reflow Oven. There too - the upgrade rework was a lot of fun! In looking at practice SMD boards - I realized that none of them had any sort of stencil. How to make one? Well, I'm thinking of something in Adobe Illustrator that will output a DXF file and convert that to g-code, perhaps with <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/dxf2gcode/wiki/User%20Guide%20DXF2GCODE/">dxf2gcode</a>. (it is a shame the sourceforge site continues to be so riddled with ad-spam but <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">pi-hole</a> really helps block much of the crap), See also <a href="http://grauonline.de/wordpress/?page_id=3211">grauonline blog: "CNC Milling: From DXF Files to g-code using free software</a>. Note the google drive download link there is a bit dated.&nbsp;
</div>
<br />

<div>
I ordered some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X7V37KX/">3 mil Blank Stencil Mylar Sheets</a> that should be here next weekend. From what I could tell from a variety of google searches, the thinner 3 mil mylar should have less of a tendency to have the solder paste stick when removed from the PCB. We'll see. 
</div>
 <br />

There's definitely a learning curve for any CNC machine. I somewhat lost interest out of frustration in converting file formats from various editors to g-code. I spent a bit of time learning Fusion 360. It is great for drawing, but getting the data out to actually machine something is another story. Note that <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/fusion-360/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Where-are-my-Fusion-360-files.html">Fusion 360 is a cloud product, and the files are stored primarily in the cloud</a>. 
</div>
 <br />Here's a guy that says 
<a href="https://forum.kicad.info/t/machine-cnc-for-kicad-and-3d-pinter/4235/2">
"It is possible to do PCBs on this sort of set up but it is not easy to get good results."</a><br />
<br />View Gerber files online for free at&nbsp;
<a href="http://gerblook.org/">gerblook.org</a>
.<br />

<div>
More recently, I found this&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/pcb2gcode/pcb2gcode/blob/master/README.md">pcb2gcode</a>&nbsp;that will taker gerber files directly from KiCAD and generate g-code&nbsp;(the commandline parameters are somewhat extensive, so the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/pcb2gcode/pcb2gcodeGUI">pcb2gcodeGUI</a>&nbsp;is recommended).
</div>
<br /> 

<div>
<a href="https://github.com/pcb2gcode/pcb2gcode/blob/master/README.md#common-build-steps">Install of pcb2gcode</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pcb2gcode/pcb2gcodeGUI#build">pcb2gcodeGUI</a> was fairly straighforward on WSL: 

{% include code_header.html %}
<pre class="language highlighter-rouge">
<code class="highlight">
cd /mnt/c/workspace
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git build-essential automake autoconf autoconf-archive 
sudo apt-get install libtool librsvg2-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-program-options-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev gerbv 
git clone https://github.com/pcb2gcode/pcb2gcode.git
cd pcb2gcode
autoreconf -fvi
./configure
make
sudo make install
cd /mnt/c/workspace
sudo apt-get install build-essential git qt5-default libqt5svg5-dev
git clone https://github.com/pcb2gcode/pcb2gcodeGUI.git
cd pcb2gcodeGUI/
qmake
make
sudo make install</code></pre>
  
<div>
    Of course to actually run on WSL, an X-Windows server is needed, such as <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/">VcXsrv</a>. It can be either run from <code class="highlight">C:\Program Files\VcXsrv\</code>
 or launched directly from WSL:     <br />
    
<br />     	

{% include code_header.html %}

<pre class="language highlighter-rouge">
<code class="highlight">
"/mnt/c/Program Files/VcXsrv/vcxsrv.exe" &amp; pcb2gcodeGUI &amp;     </code></pre>
Note that both the Windows <code class="highlight">vcxsrv.exe</code> and the <code class="highlight">pcb2gcodeGUI</code> are blocking apps. So instead of having 2 additional, blocked WSL windows, the ampersands allow the       commands to be launched in parallel. The trailing "<code class="highlight"> &amp; </code>" allows for return to current terminal bash prompt (just press enter).

There are <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1487555/how-to-troubleshoot-opengl-on-ubuntu-under-windows-10-wsl">some comments about disabling OpenGL</a>. I did have an odd problem with sigrok pulseview not sizing properly. Note to self to revisit <a href="https://discord.com/channels/613131135903596547/613133241683279873/742553636307075114">the thread on discord</a> to see if the OpenGL settings have any effect (in particular the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/smunaut/iua">iua for iCEBreaker</a>
).   <br />
  
<br />  There's the option of 
<code class="highlight">export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=0</code> or the passing the <code class="highlight">-wgl</code> to vcxsrv. Note also the <code class="highlight">export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1</code> mentioned in the comments of my&nbsp;<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-27-risc-v-on-tinyfpga-bx-via-wsl-with %}">RISC-V on tinyFPGA-BX via WSL blog</a>.

<div>
Note that most of the inexpensive CNC machines doe not have limit switches pre-installed. I bought some of the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4971">markerbot-style boards</a>.&nbsp;
</div>
<br />

<div>
There's a <a href="https://github.com/gnea/grbl/issues/380#issuecomment-366538842">comment on GitHub</a> about "<i>endstop PCBs connect the NC switch terminal directly to +5 V, in addition to having a pullup resistor on the C terminal</i>" so care should be taken on the wiring. This is easily solved by snipping off the NC pin as show on the <a href="https://softsolder.com/2017/11/30/mpcnc-makerbot-style-endstop-switch-modification/">MPCNC: Makerbot-style Endstop Switch Modification blog</a>.
