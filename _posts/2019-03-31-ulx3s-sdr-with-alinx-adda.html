Last year, I wrote about the ALINX&nbsp;<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-30-ad9280-ad9708-ad-da-module-for-ax %}">AD/DA Module</a> that I found on fleabay. Anyone interested in this board should certainly watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seHwp0WN1oU">video</a>
 posted by opentechlab.<br />

Key tidbits of information from the video:
<br />
<br />
<ul><li>
DAC is powered by onboard 3.3V regulator.</li></ul><br />
<br />
<ul><li>
Output from the DAC is differential 3vpp; (true output is difference) each output goes though a low pass filter for anti-aliasing.&nbsp;</li></ul><br />
<br />
<ul><li>
Fed into AD 8056 op-amp to convert differential signal to single-ended and level shift from 3vpp to 10vpp (-5 to +5V)</li></ul><br />
<br />
<ul><li>
Potentiometer is used to control gain of output.</li></ul><br />
<br />
<ul><li>
There's a bit of input protection on the ADC.</li></ul><br />
<br />
<ul><li>
Input filter converts 10vpp to 3vpp for ADC chip.</li></ul><br />
<br />
<ul><li>
MC34063 Step-Up/Down/Inverting Switching Regulators to generate negative rail for output from single +5VDC supply.</li></ul><br />
