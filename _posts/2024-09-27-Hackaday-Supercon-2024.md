I gave a presentation at [Hackaday Supercon 2024](https://hackaday.com/tag/2024-hackaday-supercon/) in Pasadena, CA.

Thank you to everyone that attended. You were part of an awesome, much-appreciated attentive and kind audience.

Thanks also to all the folks that gave such great feedback and compliments afterward!

I hope you came away inspired with new ideas to repurpose not only ESP32-based commercial products,
but many other products - perhaps if only to reuse a nice enclosure.

You saw how easy it is to use the latest open source, commercial-grade encryption software that
is built-in to example code such as that for the Apple HomeKit.
