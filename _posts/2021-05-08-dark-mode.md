What's a blog without dark mode? My [prior blog home](https://gojimmypi.blogspot.com/) had _only_ dark mode.
I was inspired by [Aleksandr's blog](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/) with a clever little lamp that toggles
between light and dark mode.
<!-- more -->
Hopefully for others, he will [write a blog](https://github.com/AleksandrHovhannisyan/aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/issues/72)
on this topic. I ended up spending the time to reverse engineer it and apply to this fork of gridster theme.

Update: as it turns out, [Aleksandr will not be creating a blog](https://github.com/AleksandrHovhannisyan/aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/issues/72#issuecomment-863587409),
and also prefers that I [not use his lamp](https://github.com/AleksandrHovhannisyan/aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/issues/72#issuecomment-863973848).
Although I personally really like the lamp idea, after a conversation with a graphic artist regarding what is more intuitive for end users,
I ended up instead switching to the more common and open source [sun](https://github.com/gojimmypi/gridster-jekyll-theme/tree/gh-pages/icons/light_mode_white_24dp.svg)
and [moon](https://github.com/gojimmypi/gridster-jekyll-theme/tree/gh-pages/icons/dark_mode_black_24dp.svg) icons from google's [material design](https://fonts.google.com/icons).

It is probably a good idea to not hardcode color values, as mentioned in [Derek Kedziora's Dark Mode Revisited](https://derekkedziora.com/blog/dark-mode-revisited).
The default [Jekyll Gridster theme](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/gridster-jekyll-theme) I am using has a bunch of hardcoded values, so that's another thing to fix.

The key is the JavaScript `toggle` method that removes a class if already present, otherwises adds the class:

{% include code_header.html %}
``` css

document.body.classList.toggle("dark-theme", forceDarkMode)

```

## Adding New Dark Mode Items

There are two places to make changes: The javascript toggle, and the CSS style.

For instance, to change the [color palette](https://github.com/gojimmypi/gojimmypi.github.io/blob/80de44b54c4deafc49bb62681e3c1d1bda44bf5f/_includes/nav.html#L108)
note that one of the parent `div` classes is `color-change`. A line is added to the [ToggleDarkMode](https://github.com/gojimmypi/gojimmypi.github.io/blob/34d43ab16f5ef48c408b3385546f5216b77f6c83/_includes/_dark_mode.js#L48)
function:

```javascript
ToggleDarkModeItem('.color-change', forceDarkMode);
```

To actually toggle to a dark mode class, we need to have _defined_ that class. This is typically included in [_lamp.scss](https://github.com/gojimmypi/gojimmypi.github.io/blob/master/_sass/partials/components/_lamp.scss)
for instance add [this line](https://github.com/gojimmypi/gojimmypi.github.io/blob/53c9b98905f562db2289e1b6eda42e771b1c7811/_sass/partials/components/_lamp.scss#L36)
to the comma-separated list of elements and classes. (recall classes are names with a dot-prefix):
```
.color-change.dark-theme,
```

See `_includes/_dark_mode.js` typically found in the `_includes/footer.html`.

The `_sass/partials/components/_lamp.css` contains the classes for all dark mode toggles:

{% include code_header.html %}
``` css
head.dark-theme,
article.dark-theme,
.sidebar.dark-theme,
code.dark-theme,
body.dark-theme {
    color: #eee;
    background: #121212;

    a {
        color: antiquewhite;
    }

    a:hover {
        color: white;
        text-decoration-color: white;
        text-decoration: underline;
    }
}
```

Code snippet syntax highlighting is implemented with [rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/) and is installed with:
```
gem install rouge
```

To toggle dark-mode, the `rougify style base16.dark > github.dark.css` command was used
(there does not seem to yet be a `github.dark` implemented). The resultant file had all the
`.highlight ` text segments removed, then was all placed within the `code.dark-theme`
in the [_lamp.scss](https://github.com/gojimmypi/gridster-jekyll-theme/blob/gh-pages/_sass/partials/components/_lamp.scss) file.
