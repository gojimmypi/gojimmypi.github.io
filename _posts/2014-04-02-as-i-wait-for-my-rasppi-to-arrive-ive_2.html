<br />As I wait for my RaspPi to arrive, I've been reading more about <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino.</a> It looks rather interesting, and until recently - I didn't even know there was "open source hardware". (ok, clearly I've spent&nbsp;too much time in the software world).&nbsp; <br /><br />I'll plan to initially spend time seeing if I can get my Raspi to talk with a pile of <a href="http://www.opto22.com/">opto22</a> devices that I have. That hardware&nbsp;use RS-485, so I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009SIDMNM/">this inexpensive USB to RS-485 adapter</a> on amazon.com (one of the answered questions specifically noted this device works with the RasPi, I hope I can get it to work, too!)<br /><br />When reading about the SD cards to use, apparently there&nbsp;was a problem in the past getting the UHS cards to work. It seems those issues have been resolved as noted on the <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_SD_cards">elinux.org RPi SD cards</a>&nbsp;site. For my RasPi, I&nbsp;ordered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00812K4V4/">SanDisk Ultra 8 GB SDHC Class 10 Flash Memory Card 30MB/s SDSDU-008G-U46</a> for less than $9, also from Amazon. (note the RPi specs say that no more than 20MB/s should be expected, so no sense in spending a ton of money on ultra-speed card). There's more performance information on the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=4076">SD Card Benchmarks here.</a><br /><br />
