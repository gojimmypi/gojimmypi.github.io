FPGA programming the Lattice Semiconductor iCE40 Ultra Plus Breakout Board.<br />

(work in progress, come back soon)

I've been wanting to learn FPGA programming for some time, and had recently taken the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-03-first-fpga-test-drive-with-altera %}">Altera Cyclone IV for a test drive</a>. I was not super impressed with the Quartus software, so I was interested in seeing how well the Lattice Diamond software worked in comparison.

<div>
I initially<a href="https://twitter.com/gojimmypi/status/989866654183051264?s=20">&nbsp;tried to order the board from DigiKey</a>. I gave up fussing with their dreadful ordering UI/UX and instead I <a href="https://twitter.com/gojimmypi/status/991334899754844160?s=20">ordered it from Mouser</a>. (specifically <a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Lattice/iCE40UP5K-B-EVN?qs=KeU%2FaRU0YVWVQ39q7XFcHg%3D%3D">this iCE40UP5K-B-EVN item</a> on the Mouser web site). The device arrived about a week later.
</div>
<br />

<div>
There was a (clearly hand-cut) quarter sheet of paper with instructions included with the board:<br />
<br />

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<a href="../images/s1600/Lattice_Insert_.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">
<img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1208" height="400" src="../images/s400/Lattice_Insert_.jpg" width="301"></a>
</div>
<br />
Mainly of interest are the links:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.latticesemi.com/ice40ultraplusbreakout">
http://www.latticesemi.com/ice40ultraplusbreakout</a><br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.latticesemi.com/software">
http://www.latticesemi.com/software</a><br />
<br />
.. and the reminder to put the jumpers on J6 in the "vertical position" (perpendicular to the jumper at J7)
<br />
<br />Despite the seemingly simply instructions, my&nbsp;
<a href="https://twitter.com/gojimmypi/status/992831289806868480?s=20">initial out of the box experience was dreadful</a>. Not only was the computer completely unable to connect to the board for the demo, but later once I was able to connect without the error, the demo didn't even work. I don't think my board shipped with the demo program installed, nor was I able to find the source code anywhere to try it.
</div>
<br />

<div>
The first problem seems to have been the fact that I already had installed FTDI drivers for my ESP32 development some time ago (specifically the rather rare JESP32). This was apparent when *both* FTDI devices were listed at the bottom of device manager, and when looking at properties - both were configured as JTAG devices:
</div>
<br />

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<a href="../images/s1600/LatticeJESP32_JTAG.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">
<img border="0" data-original-height="286" data-original-width="539" height="211" src="../images/s400/LatticeJESP32_JTAG.PNG" width="400"></a>
</div>
<br />

<div>
Looking back, I suppose this makes sense, as the JESP32 that was previously installed has the normal&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ba0sh1/status/979894658749800448?s=20">order of the devices reversed</a>:
</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">"<i>Yeah. I used FT2232H interface 0 for UART and interface 1 for JTAG. This is different from many other debuggers. Advantages being you get same /dev/ttyUSB0 UART like many other dev boards. Also (which I heard) you donâ€™t need to modify kext under OSX</i>" -&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ba0sh1">@ba0sh1</a></blockquote>
<div>
Sadly when the Lattice iCEcube2 software installs, it does not configure the ports properly. I ended up manually removing the drivers, then manually installing them. I'm pretty sure when I revisit my JESP32, it will not work.<br />
<br />
I was unable to find any useful sample code for the iCE40UP5K. I eventually found this:
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/cliffordwolf/icestorm/tree/master/examples/up5k_rgb">
https://github.com/cliffordwolf/icestorm/tree/master/examples/up5k_rgb</a><br />
<br />
I was unable to program from the Lattice iCEcube2&nbsp;software, as there was no "Tool - Program" on my menu!
<br />
<br />

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<a href="../images/s1600/Lattice_No_Program.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">
<img border="0" data-original-height="530" data-original-width="803" height="263" src="../images/s400/Lattice_No_Program.PNG" width="400"></a>
</div>
<br />
I needed to download the "Standalone Diamond Programmer" from here:
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.latticesemi.com/Products/DesignSoftwareAndIP/ProgrammingAndConfigurationSw/Programmer">
http://www.latticesemi.com/Products/DesignSoftwareAndIP/ProgrammingAndConfigurationSw/Programmer</a><br />
<br />
Don't bother using the site search to find this! Seemingly every software item *except* the one you want will be listed in the hundreds of results. (yes, I mistakenly tried installing an older version, and the iCE40UP is not listed as a device). The version that worked for me was 3.10.0.111.2 (I manually installed this one, different than the one that came with Lattice Diamond install) Specifically this link:
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.latticesemi.com/view_document?document_id=52187">
Programmer Standalone 3.10 64-bit for Windows</a><br />
<br />
From the iCECube2 output, once a project is successfully compiled, the resulting file can be found in the log output near the end (see above). In my case, the bin file was found here:
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #ad6163;">
C:/lscc/iCEcube2.2017.08/sbt_backend/Projects/blink/blink_Implmnt\sbt\outputs\bitmap</span><br />
<br />
Note the annoying, sloppy use of forward and back slashes. They will need to be edited in Windows, otherwise an error occurs when pasting in the path.
<br />
<br />

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<a href="../images/s1600/Lattice_Program_Slash_Error.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">
<img border="0" data-original-height="374" data-original-width="674" height="220" src="../images/s400/Lattice_Program_Slash_Error.PNG" width="400"></a>
</div>
<br />
Windows only likes back-slashes, so each will need to be individually changed. In my case, the default project ended up in:
<br />
<br />
C:\lscc\iCEcube2.2017.08\sbt_backend\Projects\blink\blink_Implmnt\sbt\outputs\bitmap
<br />
<br />
And the file needed (mysteriously) is prefixed with "top_". Select that bin file in the Diamond Programmer by clicking on the little 3 dot ellipsis button:
<br />
<br />

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<a href="../images/s1600/Lattice_Programmer_Blink_Parameters.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">
<img border="0" data-original-height="136" data-original-width="614" height="87" src="../images/s400/Lattice_Programmer_Blink_Parameters.PNG" width="400"></a>
</div>
<br />
It should pop up a dialog box like this:
<br />
<br />

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<a href="../images/s1600/Diamond_Programmer_Load_File.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">
<img border="0" data-original-height="401" data-original-width="686" height="233" src="../images/s400/Diamond_Programmer_Load_File.PNG" width="400"></a>
</div>
<br />
Note the device family is set to iCE40 Ultra Plus and the Device is iCE40UP5K.
<br />
<br />
Double-click on the "Operation" column (or click the "Device Properties" button) and ensure these settings are in place:
<br />
<br />

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<a href="../images/s1600/Lattice_Device_Properties.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">
<img border="0" data-original-height="347" data-original-width="530" height="261" src="../images/s400/Lattice_Device_Properties.PNG" width="400"></a>
</div>
<br />I saved my working project to GitHub here:&nbsp;
<a href="https://github.com/gojimmypi/iCE40UP5k-blink">
https://github.com/gojimmypi/iCE40UP5k-blink</a><br />
<br />Once working, when viewing with 
<a href="https://zadig.akeo.ie/">Zadig</a>
, this is what I see (note Interface 0 and Interface 1):<br />
<br />

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<a href="../images/s1600/Lattice_Zadig_0.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">
<img border="0" data-original-height="261" data-original-width="582" height="143" src="../images/s320/Lattice_Zadig_0.JPG" width="320"></a>
</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br />

</div>


<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<a href="../images/s1600/Lattice_Zadig_1.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">
<img border="0" data-original-height="256" data-original-width="579" height="141" src="../images/s320/Lattice_Zadig_1.JPG" width="320"></a>
</div>
<br />
However programming is not always successful, even if the software finds the device:
<br />

{% include code_header.html %}

<pre class="language highlighter-rouge">
<code class="highlight">
INFO - Check XCF Project: The current XCF Project is valid.
INFO - Check XCF Project: The current XCF Project is valid.
INFO - Check configuration setup: Start.
INFO - Check configuration setup: Successful (Ignored JTAG Connection Checking).
INFO - Device1 iCE40UP5K: Fast Program
 "Device detection failed. Cannot continue."
ERROR - Process Operation Failed.
INFO - Elapsed time: 00 min : 00 sec
ERROR - Operation: unsuccessful.ERROR - Programming failed.</code></pre>

<br />If the programming fails like this, try switching ports. One one computer (one that I had 
<i>not</i> installed JESP32 FTDI drivers)... I was able to program on the default "Port 0" (FTUSB-0) - on another computer (the one I previously <i>had </i>
configured FTDI drivers, I had to change to "Port 1" (FTUSB-1) in order to program.<br />
<br />

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<a href="../images/s1600/Lattice_Port_Select.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">
<img border="0" data-original-height="269" data-original-width="325" height="330" src="../images/s400/Lattice_Port_Select.PNG" width="400"></a>
</div>
<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/gojimmypi/status/992947433503010816?s=20">In the end I was eventually successful</a>
, but I don't think the iCE40UP5K is for everyone.<br />
