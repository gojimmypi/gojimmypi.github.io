<div>I bought my first-ever reflow oven!&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I've been wanting to learn to solder SMD devices in a reflow oven for a long time. I've had my eyes on that <a href="https://www.whizoo.com/reflowoven">toaster oven conversion</a> for quite a while - to the point of having the target oven in my "save for later" cart at Amazon. In the end, I chose to buy a real oven.</div><div><br /></div><div>There are tons of them for sale from a variety of vendors with probably an equal variety of reputations. I bought <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/233035490804">this one</a> from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ebay.com/usr/m18595638214-4">sm18595638214-4</a>&nbsp;seller on ebay for no particular reason other than 97%+ reputation and over 60 units sold. Despite the profile saying "Based in China", reading the small print it actually ships from USA. My oven was shipped from Southern California and arrived in only a few days via FedEx (shipping included in price!) The manufacturer is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.te168.com/">Tai'an Puhui Electric Technology Co., Ltd</a>&nbsp;(see also their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.te168.com/infrared-reflow-oven-t-962a-2-products/">T-962 product page</a>&nbsp;with quite a few PCBA machines for sale).&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5RgzrTJE1A4/X0FBgUN__QI/AAAAAAAACn0/Jnr_EWWMk6cNU_vwQRA6nFEDOhl_tm9ygCLcBGAsYHQ/s2508/IMG-20200821-WA0000.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1254" data-original-width="2508" height="256" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5RgzrTJE1A4/X0FBgUN__QI/AAAAAAAACn0/Jnr_EWWMk6cNU_vwQRA6nFEDOhl_tm9ygCLcBGAsYHQ/w512-h256/IMG-20200821-WA0000.jpeg" width="512" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div><div><br /></div></div><div>What's the first thing to do?

Actually, I think it should really be a bit bigger. There's plenty of space in the oven, and I had a difficult time inserting the thermocouples (with relatively large connectors) into the green header. Note there are 4 channels available for thermocouples. The oven comes equipped with only two.</div><div><br /></div><div>Essentials:</div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>T-962A&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/UnifiedEngineering/T-962-improvements/blob/master/schematic-T962.pdf">Schematic</a></li><li><a href="http://www.flashmagictool.com/">Flash Magic Tool</a><br /></li><li><a href="http://www.nxp.com/documents/user_manual/UM10120.pdf">NXP LM213x Microcontroller </a><br /></li></ul></div><div>Optional Items:</div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Additional <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/303637002716">pair of K-Type Thermocouples</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07477NMF4">Grill Thermometer</a> for calibration / verification</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LB0M8S/">Replacement Fan</a><br /></li></ul></div><div><br /></div><div>Things to review in advance:</div><div><br /></div><div>My unit had some sharp edges on the drawer. Some fine sandpaper is wise to round them a bit so fingers are not cut.</div><div><br /></div><div>I powered up the unit to make sure it was at least operational. The first thing I noticed is that the little&nbsp; fan is indeed rather loud. Unless the oven is used a lot, I later learned that this fan is only used to attempt to keep the cold junction as a reasonable temperature- so it could probably be removed altogether. Probably just as well to replace it.</div><div><br /></div>I had a difficult time removing the drawer. The instructions where to "<i>lift the black latch</i>". On my unit, the one on the left is released by pushing up. However the latch on the right is released by pushing <i>down</i>. I of course started on the right. Perhaps no big deal - but keep in mind the rails are also sticky with lubricant.<div><br /></div><div>Push the black lever <b>up </b>on the left:</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VzGvJrM3e2w/X0FHaryEwnI/AAAAAAAACoU/9ynsWw0XsK0lObzbxdg3aiS9YbRsWnK6gCLcBGAsYHQ/s2508/drawer%2Bleft.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1254" data-original-width="2508" height="256" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VzGvJrM3e2w/X0FHaryEwnI/AAAAAAAACoU/9ynsWw0XsK0lObzbxdg3aiS9YbRsWnK6gCLcBGAsYHQ/w512-h256/drawer%2Bleft.jpg" width="512" /></a></div><div><br /><div>Push the black lever <b>down</b> on the right:</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-doEBRlcv0zU/X0FHrZe8TEI/AAAAAAAACoc/yAs-lWtKhDoktBykvcl34lXlaOU5yYxGACLcBGAsYHQ/s2508/drawer%2Bright.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1254" data-original-width="2508" height="256" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-doEBRlcv0zU/X0FHrZe8TEI/AAAAAAAACoc/yAs-lWtKhDoktBykvcl34lXlaOU5yYxGACLcBGAsYHQ/w512-h256/drawer%2Bright.jpg" width="512" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>The first modification is probably the most important.

Mine was so obnoxiously load I ended up cutting the wires just to silent it. (There's no fan check circuitry) Oh, and this specific fan needs to have the hole drilled out with a 1/8" bit. Perhaps the existing screws could be force-tapped into the plastic, but I didn't want to break it.<br /><div><br /></div></div><div>Piotr mentions disconnecting the solid state relay connection, but does say <i>why</i>. Putting my board into bootloader mode immediately shows why this is a good idea: mine turned on! I'm glad the SSR was disconnected. It was a bit startling, as I had never heard the large fan running. Other than the power-up test, I proceeded directly to modification.</div><div><br /></div><div>Perhaps you've noticed this in the <a href="https://github.com/UnifiedEngineering/T-962-improvements/wiki/Better-thermocouple-interface">better thermocouple interface page</a>:&nbsp;</div>     <div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FcOY3fWuxEU/X0E0l-Rhs7I/AAAAAAAACnc/KkYqPQfZx8YGhNstyNe5VvJFEE5ZOxzzQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1030/cold%2Bjunction%2Bsensor.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="818" data-original-width="1030" height="406" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FcOY3fWuxEU/X0E0l-Rhs7I/AAAAAAAACnc/KkYqPQfZx8YGhNstyNe5VvJFEE5ZOxzzQCLcBGAsYHQ/w512-h406/cold%2Bjunction%2Bsensor.png" width="512" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>That's the cold-junction sensor down in the lower right. But notice the yellow circle. It sure looks like the Vdd and GND pins are tied together to ground. Sure enough, this is consistent with the <a href="https://github.com/UnifiedEngineering/T-962-improvements/blob/master/schematic-T962.pdf">schematic</a> in that both <a href="https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS18B20.pdf">DS18B20</a>&nbsp;pins are grounded. This is a clever idea, as from the <a href="https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS18B20.pdf">datasheet</a>&nbsp;(see page 7), this device has a <i>parasite </i>mode:</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Im-Ca4Vxzuc/X0E3xYr5-JI/AAAAAAAACno/eyIoQQ5EKuwCSAJzlx-LYqBNfdCdV3NlQCLcBGAsYHQ/s347/DS18B20%2Bparasite%2Bpower.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="200" data-original-width="347" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Im-Ca4Vxzuc/X0E3xYr5-JI/AAAAAAAACno/eyIoQQ5EKuwCSAJzlx-LYqBNfdCdV3NlQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/DS18B20%2Bparasite%2Bpower.png" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>Still, it may not be clear as to why this cold junction sensor is on the main board, at the <i>old junction</i>, and not on the new mod board. It is a leftover from a prior upgrade, as there's a <a href="https://github.com/UnifiedEngineering/T-962-improvements/wiki/Better-thermocouple-interface">note</a> "<i>the cold-junction sensor is still present on my board, but not used when the external TC IF is detected</i>".</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Ok, so on to the upgrade!</div><div><br /></div>     <div>Key to the firmware upgrade is the ISP connector:</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3HR6WqiPjJc/X0FU_09_KpI/AAAAAAAACpU/VpBQioQyXNwG7M4Np0yqYHm6jCrFIBKagCLcBGAsYHQ/s702/ISP%2Bschematic.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="274" data-original-width="702" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3HR6WqiPjJc/X0FU_09_KpI/AAAAAAAACpU/VpBQioQyXNwG7M4Np0yqYHm6jCrFIBKagCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/ISP%2Bschematic.png" width="640" /></a></div><div>Although a variety of hardware programmers are possible, I used a simple USB to TTL device and manually fiddled with the ISP and Reset lines.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Fortunately the manufacturer kindly installed a header.

So I added these tie wraps:</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fzPCq9JYr-c/X0LW6UuhL2I/AAAAAAAACsU/KXjWGmRnerMNt2gTtMreNsN8L2G6PBAagCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/thermocouple%2Btiewraps%2Bwith%2Bboxes.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="1600" height="256" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fzPCq9JYr-c/X0LW6UuhL2I/AAAAAAAACsU/KXjWGmRnerMNt2gTtMreNsN8L2G6PBAagCLcBGAsYHQ/w512-h256/thermocouple%2Btiewraps%2Bwith%2Bboxes.jpg" width="512" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>Note the main strain relief (1) for the fairly rigid thermocouple wires. There's another tie-wrap (2) in the empty PCB hole - positioned to keep the next tie wrap (3) on the thermocouple wires away from the main PCB. This tie wrap has the respective tail taped down as an extra measure of stability. In addition to the kapton tape underneath, there's a small piece of card stock under the tape (part of the fan packaging was used here) for additional electrical insulation. By far the (1) tie-wrap does most of the work to keep the new interface board in a stable position.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>A better solution would be to drill a couple of mounting holes instead of the (2) and (3) tie wraps. I will probably do that when my other 2 K-Type thermocouples arrive. Alternatively, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M6U9Q9C/">cable management clips</a> might work (depending the strength of the adhesive)</div><div><br /></div><div>Back to the project blog from that initially working state...</div><div><br /></div><div>However this is where things took a turn for the worse. I powered on the unit. The display was blank! Oh no! How could that be? I took a short break to think about it. Was this the end? $400 down the toilet?</div><div><br /></div><div>I refused to give up. I'm not new at this. Prior to being only a software engineer, I spent nearly a decade at a small industrial manufacturing company, building and repairing <i>all sorts</i> of crazy things big and small. I didn't do anything wrong here. No magic smoke, no mishaps. What went wrong?</div><div><br /></div><div>So ok, let's backtrack. What's different? Well the Thermocouple board is connected, but duh, how could that affect this display. It shouldn't... but let's go back to a known working state. I removed the board. Nothing. Still a blank display at power up. No fun if it is too easy, right? Could it have damaged the display? No way.</div><div><br /></div><div>Perhaps the firmware got corrupted and crashed? I hooked up the computer again, flashed fresh firmware. Success! Ok, cool, that was odd, but let's proceed.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I reconnected thee thermocouple board. <i>The display was blank again</i>! Are you kidding me? So let's repeat the routine: remove thermocouple board, fresh firmware, it works! Ok, fool me once...</div><div><br /></div><div>Clearly something else going on here. So instead of flashing firmware, I hooked up that serial port to see what sort of messages are displayed at startup time. It's completely happy! No indication of problem, erm - other than the blank display.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oSoS2_PbeNg/X0Fsznc4TxI/AAAAAAAACrE/NQdUheKcuWcTbLGsZssvaKEFTjTMW2afQCLcBGAsYHQ/s770/boot.PNG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="566" data-original-width="770" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oSoS2_PbeNg/X0Fsznc4TxI/AAAAAAAACrE/NQdUheKcuWcTbLGsZssvaKEFTjTMW2afQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/boot.PNG" width="640" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div><div>How can that be? Well, since I had everything hooked up again, it was easier to restart by bringing the RESET pin low, instead of reaching for the power switch. Success! Yes, after a&nbsp;<i>reset&nbsp;</i>- the display works just fine. This was never about the external board or the firmware. It was always about the after-powerup <i>reset</i>.That certainly falls into the undesired feature category.</div><div><br /></div></div><div>How can this be a problem? The factory firmware certainly did not have this issue. The Microcontoller does indeed have reset startup circuity built in. Is this is a software issue or a hardware issue?</div><div><br /></div><div>There's a mystery mod that I have not been able to identify:</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V4tqt3AsFsU/X0FujBo8sFI/AAAAAAAACrQ/YEyg7aIYZ4AwqcfPSMOV0zTgtt9eNxKFQCLcBGAsYHQ/s749/mystery%2Bmod.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="491" data-original-width="749" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V4tqt3AsFsU/X0FujBo8sFI/AAAAAAAACrQ/YEyg7aIYZ4AwqcfPSMOV0zTgtt9eNxKFQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/mystery%2Bmod.png" width="640" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>I remember seeing these resistors when reading about the mod before ordering my oven. Note not only the radial-lead resistors tacked on o the chip, but there's also a small SMD (probably a pullup) on the thermocouple board connection. I wonder what they do? Surely resistors alone will not resolve the new-found reset problem.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm not the first person to encounter this <a href="https://github.com/UnifiedEngineering/T-962-improvements/issues/186">issue</a>, however <a href="https://twitter.com/gojimmypi/status/1297197154289606657?s=20">@tnt completed this process in January with no problems</a>&nbsp;(but he also built from the git repo).</div><div><br /></div><div>Ok, so I needed find a solution for the reset problem. Perhaps some sort of RC delay? That seems <i>too </i>hackish. It may be temperature related, as upon fresh power up later in the day, I didn't the reset problem at all. The display is working fine. Even waiting only a couple of second after power down and turning on the oven - the display is working fine. Then few hours later, the display problem had returned! This time it may have been in bootloader mode as the big fan came on while the display was blank and the heater came on!! I thought that the problem may be related to my franken-ribbon cable on the ISP (see below) - but no, removing that completely and random startup problem remained.</div><div><br /></div><div>Reminder: The display<i> is supposed to be blank</i> in bootloader mode. But the unit should never boot into bootloader mode when simply powering up.</div><div><br /></div><div>Ok, so if we take another look at the reset circuitry (above)... well, there is none. ~RESET on pin 57 appears to just go straight to the header.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Two of the most common solutions to the worlds problems are (1) decoupling capacitors and (2) pullup resistors. Pullup it is! As it turned out, there's a large through-hole nearby that has 3v3 available:</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--aYkRbgVOJY/X0K31XBX4AI/AAAAAAAACsA/fsOksmLRFVoJWZFQciyxkfRbf-glSPMEACLcBGAsYHQ/s452/available%2B3v3.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="452" data-original-width="376" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--aYkRbgVOJY/X0K31XBX4AI/AAAAAAAACsA/fsOksmLRFVoJWZFQciyxkfRbf-glSPMEACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/available%2B3v3.png" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>I crimped a 10K resistor to the header connector on the reset line.

So far, so good! I've not yet seen the blank display problem return!</div><div><br /></div><div>As the header access is buried inside, I wanted something a bit more accessible.
