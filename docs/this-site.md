This is a sample.

Jekyll uses the [shopify Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) and has some [specific additions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/) 
to [filters](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/filters/) and [tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/). 
See also the comparisons for the [variations of liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/variations/).
