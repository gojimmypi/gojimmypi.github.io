This is the blog site for [gojimmypi](./author/gojimmypi/), moved to github after several years at [https://gojimmypi.blogspot.com/](https://gojimmypi.blogspot.com/).

The [source code for this web site](https://github.com/gojimmypi/gojimmypi.github.io) is based on a [fork](https://github.com/gojimmypi/gridster-jekyll-theme) 
of the [ickc fork](https://github.com/ickc/gridster-jekyll-theme),
of the [DigitalMindCH/gridster-jekyll-theme](https://github.com/DigitalMindCH/gridster-jekyll-theme)

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, 
as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)

There's a [sitemap here](https://gojimmypi.github.io/sitemap.xml)

There is only one domain registered at this time:  [gojimmypi.com](https://gojimmypi.com)

Issues that need to be addressed:

* Page load times are rather long. See [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgojimmypi.github.io&utm_source=google_domains&utm_medium=product&utm_campaign=website_card&hl=en-US)
* jQuery needs to be updated.
* There's an annoying flash of white before the site initially loads in dark mode.
* Is `/js/materialize.min.js` actually needed? Can it be removed?
