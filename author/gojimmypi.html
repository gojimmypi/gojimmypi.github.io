Hello World.

This is the web site were I write random musings and various "notes to self" for future reference about various technology that I'm interested in learning more about.

Hopefully someone else may find something useful and infomrative here as well.

At this time, this is not a sponsored web site. No ads. Opinions are my own.

I also post some microblogs on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gojimmypi).

I'm on [mastodon.online/@gojimmypi](https://mastodon.online/@gojimmypi), moving to [hackaday.social/@gojimmypi](https://hackaday.social/@gojimmypi).

I'm a volunteer member of [Radiona NGO](https://radiona.org/about/members/).

I'm a part time contractor at [wolfSSL](https://www.wolfssl.com/).
