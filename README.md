## Site feedback & TODO list

There are pros and cons of this web site architecture.

At the moment, most seem to be cons. The original example used a bunch of cute add-ins, that over
time have turned out to be more of a liability.

Things I like:

* Create a new post & have all the infrastructure updated automatically: tags, contents, etc.
* My implementation of the "infinite scroll" that pops new items into view as needed
* My implementation of the "light/dark" mode button
* Left panel contents by keyword automatically generated.
* Jump directly to GitHub source from each page via octocat in upper right.

Things that need attention:

* Search not working.
* The fonts used are complex and can be improved.
* There's an undesired white flash when first visiting each page when in dark mode.
* Some of the bloat features need to be removed, e.g. [Ruby Sass has reached end-of-life and should no longer be used](https://twitter.com/gojimmypi/status/1670903518700638209?s=20).
* The "categories" is not working properly.
* The menu bar layout and spacing at the top of the screen needs to be improved.
* It would be nice to have a mini image of the first image of each post on the main page.
